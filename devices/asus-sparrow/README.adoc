== Device-specific notes

=== Boot modes

Recovery and bootloader (fastboot) modes are unusual to enter into compared to
phones.

When the watch boots, as early as possible when the display is turned on, do
one of the following to enter a given boot mode:

* recovery: swipe from the top right towards the bottom left
* bootloader: swipe from the top left towards the bottom right

== Factory images

It seems there are no official factory images for the Zenwatch 2.

However, OTA update files can be used to re-install Wear OS. Using the OTA 
update files re-install is out of scope for this document.

One arbitrary known OTA update package:
