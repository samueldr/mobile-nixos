== Device-specific notes

=== Mainline

It seems bootloader command-line arguments are not taken into account when
booting the mainline kernel when using `CONFIG_CMDLINE_FROM_BOOTLOADER`.

For the time being, customizing the kernel command-line requires editing the
`config.aarch64` file for this device.
